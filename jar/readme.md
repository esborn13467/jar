Anne 
You are the kind of beautiful that doesn't need permission.
It's in your smile, your thoughts, your presence.
The world doesn’t always know how to honor softness, but yours is powerful.
The way you carry yourself recently ,even on your low days,is art
Don’t ever shrink to fit into someone else's small idea of beauty.
You are already more than enough. Bold. Rare. Unrepeatable.
hope you know that
more than anyone
Mirror or no mirror  you're stunning. Inside out. Always.
